"""
    shm = SharedMemory(id, len; perms=0o600, volatile=true)

creates a new shared memory object identified by `id` and whose size is `len` bytes. The
identifier `id` can be a string starting by a `'/'` to create a POSIX shared memory object
or a System V IPC key to create a System V shared memory segment. In this latter case, the
key can be `IPC.PRIVATE` to automatically create a non-existing shared memory segment.

Keyword `perms` is to specify the access permissions to be granted. By default, only
reading and writing by the user are granted.

Keyword `volatile` is to specify whether the shared memory is volatile or not. If
non-volatile, the shared memory will remain accessible until explicit destruction or
system reboot. If volatile (the default), the shared memory is automatically destroyed
when no longer in use by any processes.

To retrieve an existing shared memory object, call:

    shm = SharedMemory(id; readonly=false)

where `id` is the shared memory identifier (a string, an IPC key, or a System V IPC
identifier of shared memory segment as returned by [`ShmId`](@ref)). Keyword `readonly`
can be set true if only read access is needed. Note that method `shmid(obj)` may be called
to retrieve the identifier of the shared memory object `obj`.

A number of accessors are available for a shared memory objects `shm`:

    pointer(shm)    # base address of the shared memory
    sizeof(shm)     # number of bytes of the shared memory
    shmid(shm)      # identifier of the shared memory

To ensure that shared memory object `shm` is eventually destroyed, call:

    rm(shm)

`key` and check to see if the user has permission to access the segment. Bit `IPC_EXCL`
